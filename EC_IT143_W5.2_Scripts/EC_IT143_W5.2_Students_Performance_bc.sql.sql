FROM

    AvgMathScore DESC;

-- Q4: What percentage of students scored above 90 in all three subjects, and what do they have in common in terms of background?
-- A4: These students likely have strong academic backgrounds and access to resources.
--     Author: Baimba Conteh

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS HighScoringStudents,
    SUM(CASE WHEN math_score >= 90 AND reading_score >= 90 AND writing_score >= 90 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS PercentageHighScoring
FROM 
    StudentsPerformance;

-- Note: This question requires detailed analysis of multiple factors like lunch status, test prep, and parental education.
